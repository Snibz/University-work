Selected work from university courses I've completed. Note that many excercises had a base code given by Tampere University - for example, COMP.CS.110 had base code on almost every excercise.
I decided to include all of COMP.CS.120 as all of it is my own code.

Code may not run well; all different courses done in different IDEs, different platforms also used:
COMP.CS.110 done in a Linux environment, 120 and 140 on Windows.
